# WayfairCatalogManagementBE
Onboarding project backend on first coop

Main path to non-generated code is WayfairCatalogBE/trainingWCM/trainingWCM/src/main/java/WCM/trainingWCM/
Ignore the horrible naming conventions, this was a solo project and I realized it too late.

Written in Java using Springboot and maven for dependencies. Front-end was created using React.js and is its own repository. Database was a local mySQL server. All developments were completed on local device.
